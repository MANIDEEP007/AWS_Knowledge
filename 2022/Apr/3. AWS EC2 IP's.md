# Private IP
- Machines with Private IP can only be identifiable on Private network
- IP should be unique across the private network
- Two different private network can have same IP's
- Machines with Private IP's can connect to internet using Internet Gateway
- Only Specified range of IP's can be used for private IP's
# Public IP
- Machine with public IP will be Identifiable on Internet & Geo-Locatable
- It must be unique across whole web
# Elastic IP
- In AWS, Public IP for instance changes when restarted
- To have fixed public IP for instance, the solution is Elastic IP
- Its an IP for your own as long as you don't delete it
- It can be attached to single instance only
- Useful in masking failure of instance
- Try to avoid using Elastic IP and instead  use Load Balancers
- Elastic IP can allocated from AWS
- We Will be charged for Elastic IP even if we are not attaching to an instance
- Elastic IP can be attached to network interface as well
- It's good practice to release Elastic IP when not in use
