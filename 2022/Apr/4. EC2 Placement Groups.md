# Placement Group
- Placement Group means strategy of placing EC2 instances
### Cluster Based
- Cluster instances in Single AZ
- i.e. Instances will be in Same Rack and in Same AZ
- These has Great Network Speed & Low latency
- Main disadvantage is if the rack fails, all instance fails at same time
- Example use cases are Big Data Jobs, Low Latency Apps
### Spread Based
- This strategy is for Critical & High Availability Apps
- Spread instance across underlying hardware(i.e. max 7 for AZ)
- It minimizes failure risk
- Reduces simultaneous failure of instances
### Partition Based
- Spread instance across partitions with in an AZ
- 7 Partitions per AZ
- Partition can have multiple instances
- Safe from Rack Failure
- Example use cases are HDFS, Hbase, Cassandra Apps
# Creating Placement Groups
- Under Network & Security Tab in EC2 section, we can create them
- Give name & choose strategy
- While creating instance, we can attach them to placement group
