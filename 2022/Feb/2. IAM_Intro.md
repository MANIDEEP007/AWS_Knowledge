IAM
-----
- IAM stands for Identity & Access Management is a Global Service in AWS
- When you create an AWS account, basically its root account
- Root account should not be used or shared. Instead you need an User with AdministratorAccess policy and use it
- In an Organization, From root account, the Admin accounts, Users, Groups & Policies will be created
- Note that root account will have an numerical ID. As its difficult to remember we need to create Alias from IAM Dashboard and use it to login as IAM user
- In AWS IAM, nesting of groups is not possible
- User need not be mapped to a single group and can be assigned policies directly which are called inline policies
- An User can be part of multiple groups and all the policies of the group where User is a member will apply
# Example Policies:
- AdministratorAccess - Access similar to that of root user
- IAMReadOnlyAccess - Only Get or List operations in IAM are allowed
