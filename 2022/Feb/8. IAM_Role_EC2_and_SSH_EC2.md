# Attach IAM Role to EC2
- Never store Access Keys in EC2 Machines. Its very risky and may be exposed in some cases
- Instead attach IAM Roles to EC2 instance
- With IAM roles, we can have more control of what actions can be taken in EC2 instance for AWS services
- To attach IAM role to EC2 instance
- Go to EC2  Page in AWS
- Select Instance
- Click Actions
- Select Security
- Then Modify IAM Role
- Finally Attach desired IAM Role
# SSH to EC2 instance
- To login into instance use **ssh -i Key Username@IP**. This key file we will be generating and downloading while creating instance for first time
- Make sure key permissions 0440
- For Window machine PuttyGen is used to convert pem to PPK to use it for connecting to EC2 instance
- Another option is we can connect to EC2 instance from console connect button
